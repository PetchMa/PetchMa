# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second year student @UofToronto and  **[Laidlaw Scholar](https://laidlawscholars.network/users/peter-ma)** with interests into astronomy, physics, deep learning research. 

I current work two research projects **[@UC BerkeleySETI](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI)** and **[@Dunalp Insitute of Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/)**

At **[@UC BerkeleySETI](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI)** I am building a high performance ML search pipeline for the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa with [Dr. Cherry Ng](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/dr-cherry-ng/). My research looks into leveraging geometric Bayesian deep learning models in detecting transients in multi beam telescope data! At **[@Dunalp Insitute of Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/)** I am working at developing probablistic deep learning algorithms for Fast Radio Burst searches! I'll be supervised by [Prof. Bryan Gaensler](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/prof-bryan-gaensler-2/)! 

Previously, I've worked on building the first comprehensive deep learning based search pipeline on the Greenbank telescope. And before that, I've been involved in building distributed cloud computing for astronomy research algorithms at the lab.
