# Hey There! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an 18 year old high school student in Toronto Canada who's into machine learning, astronomy, and academic research. Currently I'm an intern researcher @UCBerkeleySeti building and scaling astronomy search algorithms to the cloud using things like, GCP, Kubernetes + Docker, and flask to serve our platform! I also focus in building ML algorithms to specifically to search for signals within radio spectrograms.
