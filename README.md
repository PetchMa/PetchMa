# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year student @UofT and **[Laidlaw Scholar](https://laidlawscholars.network/users/peter-ma)**. I'm interested in leveraging ML for scientific discovery. 

**@Caltech LIGO** I work on tackling non-linear dynamic control problems using deep learning. I am specifically investigating attention-based state estimators and reinforcement learning for LIGO's locking acquisition with [Dr. Gabriele Vajente](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriele-vajente). **@UC BerkeleySETI** I'm building a geometric deep learning search pipeline for the MeerKAT telescope with [Dr. Cherry Ng](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/dr-cherry-ng/).

Previously, I was **@Dunlap Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics** working on developing ML algorithms for Fast Radio Burst detection with [Prof. Bryan Gaensler](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/prof-bryan-gaensler-2/). Before that I've worked on building the first deep learning based search pipeline using the Greenbank telescope with Berkeley SETI. During high school, I've been involved in building distributed cloud computing for astronomy research algorithms, also at Berkeley.
