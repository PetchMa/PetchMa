# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fourth year undergrad @UofT and **[Laidlaw Scholar](https://laidlawscholars.network/users/peter-ma)**. Broadly speaking, I'm interested in ML for scientific discovery in the physical sciences.

**Research Projects:**

* **@CERN** I am helping to build firmware and ML algorithms on FPGA's for the Liquid Argon Digital Signal Processor on the Large Hadron Collider. 
* **@BerkeleySETI** building a geometric deep learning search pipeline for the MeerKAT telescope. 
* **@Caltech LIGO** worked on non-linear dynamic control problems using deep learning involving reinforcement learning and probablistic learning. 
* **@Dunlap Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics** worked on developing ML algorithms for Fast Radio Burst detection.
