# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second year student @UofT and **[Laidlaw Scholar](https://laidlawscholars.network/users/peter-ma)**. I'm interested in astronomy, physics, deep learning and the nature of intelligence itself. 

Soon, I will be interning **@Caltech LIGO** working on tackling non-linear dynamic control problems using machine learning. I will be specifically investigating attention-based state estimators and reinforcement learning for LIGO's locking acquisition with [Dr. Gabriele Vajente](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriele-vajente).

Currently I am involved in two research projects. **@UC BerkeleySETI** I am building a geometric deep learning search pipeline for the MeerKAT telescope with [Dr. Cherry Ng](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/dr-cherry-ng/). **@Dunlap Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics** I am working on simulating Fast Radio Bursts and developing probabilistic deep learning algorithms for Fast Radio Burst detection with [Prof. Bryan Gaensler](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/prof-bryan-gaensler-2/)! 

Previously, I've worked on building the first deep learning based search pipeline using the Greenbank telescope. And during high school, I've been involved in building distributed cloud computing for astronomy research algorithms at Berkeley SETI.
