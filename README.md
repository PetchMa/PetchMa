# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a first year graduate student at the UC Berkeley. Broadly speaking, I'm interested in ML for scientific discovery in the physical sciences.

**Research Projects:**

* **@CERN** I helped develop firmware and ML algorithms on FPGA's as part of the Liquid Argon Digital Signal Processor upgrade on ATLAS for the future High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider. 
* **@BerkeleySETI** explored using geometric deep learning search pipeline for the MeerKAT telescope. 
* **@Caltech LIGO** I built probablistic deep learning models to solve a non-linear dynamic control problem arising in stabilizing LIGO's mirrors.
* **@Dunlap Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics** I worked on developing ML algorithms for Fast Radio Burst detection for CHIME radio telescope.
* **@University of Toronto Dept. Computer Science** I work on developing LLM for equation extraction and symbolic regression.
* **@University of Toronto Dept. Astronomy and Astrophysics** I work on developing Graph Neural Networks and Simulation Based Inferencing to infer, from stellar streams, the mass of dark matter substructure in the Milkyway.
