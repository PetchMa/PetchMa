# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year undergrad @UofT and **[Laidlaw Scholar](https://laidlawscholars.network/users/peter-ma)**. I'm interested in leveraging ML for scientific discovery. 

**@CERN** I work on the Liquid Argon Calorimeter for the Large Hadron Collider. **@BerkeleySETI** I'm building a geometric deep learning search pipeline for the MeerKAT telescope. **@Caltech LIGO** I work on non-linear dynamic control problems using deep learning involving reinforcement learning and probablistic learning. **@Dunlap Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics** worked on developing ML algorithms for Fast Radio Burst detection. Before that I've worked on building the first deep learning based search pipeline using the Greenbank telescope with Berkeley SETI. During high school, I've been involved in building distributed cloud computing for astronomy research algorithms, also at Berkeley.
