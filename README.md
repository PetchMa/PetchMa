# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second year student @UofT and **[Laidlaw Scholar](https://laidlawscholars.network/users/peter-ma)** with interests into astronomy, physics, deep learning research. 

I formally I work on two research projects. **@UC BerkeleySETI** I am building ageometric deep learning models as part of a search pipeline for the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa with [Dr. Cherry Ng](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/dr-cherry-ng/). **@Dunlap Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics** I am working at simulating Fast Radio Bursts and developing probabilistic deep learning algorithms for Fast Radio Burst searches with [Prof. Bryan Gaensler](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/prof-bryan-gaensler-2/)! 

Previously, I've worked on building the first comprehensive deep learning based search pipeline on the Greenbank telescope. And before that, I've been involved in building distributed cloud computing for astronomy research algorithms at the lab.
