# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second year student @UofToronto and  **[Laidlaw Scholar](https://laidlawscholars.network/users/peter-ma)** with interests into astronomy, physics, deep learning research. 

Currently I'm **[@UCBerkeleySETI](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI)** building a high performance ML search pipeline for the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa. My research looks into leveraging geometric Bayesian deep learning models in detecting transients in multi beam telescope data!

Previously, I've worked on building the first comprehensive deep learning based search pipeline on the Greenbank telescope. And before that, I've been involved in building distributed cloud computing infrastructure for astronomy search algorithms at the lab.
