# Hey there! 👋

I'm a second year student @UofToronto and  **[Laidlaw Scholar](https://laidlawscholars.network/users/peter-ma)** with interests into astronomy, physics, deep learning research. 

Currently I'm **[@UCBerkeleySETI](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI)** building a high performance ML search pipeline for the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa. My research looks into leveraging geometric Bayesian deep learning models in detecting transients in multi beam telescope data!

Previously, I've worked on building the first comprehensive deep learning based search pipeline on the Greenbank telescope, computing 120 terabytes of data. And before that, I've been involved in scaling astronomy search algorithms to the cloud using technologies like, GCP, Kubernetes + Docker, and flask to serve our infrastructure platform! I also focus on building ML algorithms to specifically search for signals within radio spectrograms.
