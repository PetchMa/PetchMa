# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third year undergrad @UofT and **[Laidlaw Scholar](https://laidlawscholars.network/users/peter-ma)**. Broadly speaking, I'm interested in ML for scientific discovery in the physical sciences.

**Research Projects:**

**@CERN** I am currently working on the Liquid Argon Calorimeter for the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider. 
**@BerkeleySETI** building a geometric deep learning search pipeline for the MeerKAT telescope. 
**@Caltech LIGO** worked on non-linear dynamic control problems using deep learning involving reinforcement learning and probablistic learning. 
**@Dunlap Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics** worked on developing ML algorithms for Fast Radio Burst detection.
