# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second year student @UofToronto and  **[Laidlaw Scholar](https://laidlawscholars.network/users/peter-ma)** with interests into astronomy, physics, deep learning research. 

I currently work on two research projects <a style="color:#b80707">**[@UC Berkeley SETI](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI)**</a> and **[@Dunlap Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/)**

**@UC BerkeleySETI** I am building a high performance ML search pipeline for the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa with [Dr. Cherry Ng](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/dr-cherry-ng/). My research looks into leveraging geometric deep learning models in detecting transients in multi beam telescope data! 

**@Dunlap Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics** I am working at simulating Fast Radio Bursts and developing probabilistic deep learning algorithms for Fast Radio Burst searches! I'll be working with the CHIME collaboration under the supervison of [Prof. Bryan Gaensler](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/prof-bryan-gaensler-2/)! 

Previously, I've worked on building the first comprehensive deep learning based search pipeline on the Greenbank telescope. And before that, I've been involved in building distributed cloud computing for astronomy research algorithms at the lab.
