# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second year student @UofT and **[Laidlaw Scholar](https://laidlawscholars.network/users/peter-ma)**. I'm interested in astronomy, physics, deep learning and the nature of intelligence itself. 

Currently I'm **@Caltech LIGO** working on tackling non-linear dynamic control problems using machine learning. I will be specifically investigating attention-based state estimators and reinforcement learning for LIGO's locking acquisition with [Dr. Gabriele Vajente](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriele-vajente). I am also still loosely involved **@UC BerkeleySETI** in building a geometric deep learning search pipeline for the MeerKAT telescope with [Dr. Cherry Ng](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/dr-cherry-ng/).

Previously, I was **@Dunlap Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics** working on developing ML algorithms for Fast Radio Burst detection with [Prof. Bryan Gaensler](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/prof-bryan-gaensler-2/). Before that I've worked on building the first deep learning based search pipeline using the Greenbank telescope with Berkeley SETI. During high school, I've been involved in building distributed cloud computing for astronomy research algorithms, also at Berkeley.
