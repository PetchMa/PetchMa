# Hey there! 👋

I'm a 19 year old rising second year student @UofToronto and  **[Laidlaw Scholar](https://laidlawscholars.network/users/peter-ma)** who's into astronomy, physics, machine learning and research. 

Currently I'm an intern researcher **[@UCBerkeleySETI](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI)** building a high performance ML search pipeline for the Green Bank Telescope and eventually the MeerKAT telescope in South Africa. 

Previously I've been scaling astronomy search algorithms to the cloud using technologies like, GCP, Kubernetes + Docker, and flask to serve our infrastructure platform! I also focus on building ML algorithms to specifically search for signals within radio spectrograms.
