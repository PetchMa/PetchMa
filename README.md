# Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a second year student @UofT and **[Laidlaw Scholar](https://laidlawscholars.network/users/peter-ma)**. I'm interested in astronomy, physics, deep learning and the nature of intelligence itself. 

I formally I work on two research projects. **@UC BerkeleySETI** I am building a geometric deep learning model as part of a search pipeline for the MeerKAT telescope with [Dr. Cherry Ng](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/dr-cherry-ng/). **@Dunlap Institute of Astronomy & Astrophysics** I am working on simulating Fast Radio Bursts and developing probabilistic deep learning algorithms for Fast Radio Burst detection with [Prof. Bryan Gaensler](https://www.dunlap.utoronto.ca/dunlap-people/prof-bryan-gaensler-2/)! 

Previously, I've worked on building the first deep learning based search pipeline using the Greenbank telescope. And during high school, I've been involved in building distributed cloud computing for astronomy research algorithms at Berkeley SETI.
